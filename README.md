# Device Health Monitoring AI

## Overview
An AI-powered device health monitoring system designed to detect early signs of malfunction in electrical appliances using time-series analysis and anomaly detection.

The system focuses on **predictive maintenance**, enabling proactive interventions before critical failures occur.

---

## Problem Statement
Electrical devices often fail silently before visible breakdowns occur. Traditional monitoring approaches rely on reactive alerts rather than predictive insights.

This project aims to:
- Detect abnormal behavior in device power consumption patterns
- Estimate device health status over time
- Provide early warnings for potential failures

---

## System Architecture
The system consists of the following components:
- Time-series data ingestion
- Feature extraction and normalization
- Anomaly detection model
- Health score estimation and visualization

*(Architecture diagram will be added)*

---

## Machine Learning Approach
- Time-series modeling
- Unsupervised / semi-supervised anomaly detection
- Health score computation based on anomaly density and severity

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit (for visualization)

---

## Results & Insights
- Detection of abnormal device behavior patterns
- Visualization of device health degradation
- Early warning capability before failure events

---

## Future Improvements
- Multi-device learning
- Online / streaming anomaly detection
- Deployment-ready monitoring service
